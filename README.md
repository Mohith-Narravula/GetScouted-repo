# GetScouted-repo

# Abstract 
This is group project where we are building an application for Scouts to my their life easy like making the report of each player digital entry rather than physical one, comparison between players in their performs, etc.., below you can detail explanation of this project.     

# Project Aim:				
GetScouted’s Recruitment Platform will use the art of AI, Machine Learning, Data Analytics & Biomechanics to form the basis of the platform. The app will bring the scouting, trial & development data and processes into the platform to scout top talents to accelerate the opportunities for clubs to find top young talents.	

# Description:			
The GetScouted App will be a key recruitment tool for youth level & first team level for football clubs to find their next top talent and players to buy from other clubs. The application will use machine learning and AI to predict players’ abilities. Scouts will be able to rate players and find out the player's potential ability to recruit players to the football scout’s employment club. Scouts can be rated based on the players they provide to their club and if the player has been successful at the club. This App will be used by scouts for a process before bringing in youth players on trial and signing first team players from other clubs. Players will be able to upload match footage and participate in an online trial to measure their ability for players to be rated, the App will use API to connect wearables for players to provide stats to their profile.

# The problem/The issue at hand:				
Scouts/Clubs:			
  Football scouts can not do real-time scouting digitally
  Football scouts find it hard to measure the full potential of a player
  Football clubs do not have enough data on young players they scout		

Players
  Players do not have a platform to showcase their talent
  Players can not measure their own ability
